# Trimmed lilac.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
#
# This is a complex version of lilac.py for building
# a package from AUR.
#
# You can do something before/after building a package,
# including modify the 'pkgver' and 'md5sum' in PKBUILD.
#
# This is especially useful when a AUR package is
# out-of-date and you want to build a new one, or you
# want to build a package directly from sourceforge but
# using PKGBUILD from AUR.
